I hear a lot of tradtional trap drums and sounds on the new album, which make sense since your from the south, but you didn’t really do that on Camp. Then you got something like ‘Zealots of Stockholm’ where it gets Death Grip-ish. Is it as simple as your just finding the right sound for the lyrics or do you draw from other things?\\n\\nSince your probably not going to see/respond to this, let me stan a little bit haha\\n\\nStan part: You are my role model, I can identify with your life and lyrics so well it’s crazy. I really hope in 10 years I can be as successful and well respected as you. I already liked your comedy and acting, but ever since I found out you rapped and I heard that E.E. Cummings line in ‘Freaks and Geeks’ I was hooked. Anyway, The new album is dope as heck, great work as always sir, and I can’t wait to see what you do in the future\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n@ChildishGambino\\n\\nHa. thanks\\n\\nI try not to think to hard about what’s trap drums, what’s influenced by who’s hot now, and all that. i try to just find what feels honest. cause i don’t know if i’d wanna hear a song that was considered entire original by everyone, but was no fun to make. this album, tho it came from a messy place, was by far the most fun to make@SavvyRJA\\n\\nIt sounds like you are influecnced by john lennon quite alot? care to elaborate?\\n\\n@ChildishGambino\\n\\nTo be honest, i don’t know much about him. i was always a beach boys dude over beatles. i learned a little about him through jhene@SavvyRJA\\n\\nWho is your favorite artist outside of Hip-Hop?\\n\\nPerosnally, Gorillaz or Red Hot Chilli Peppers\\n\\n@ChildishGambino\\n\\nAnything by sam cooke@griffinmahon\\n\\nDo you think there is more room for expression or creativity in short films as opposed to full-length movies? Does this translate to the relationship between mixtapes and albums in rap?\\n\\n@ChildishGambino\\n\\nShort films just fit normal people a little better. time is ultimate currency. we don’t have a lot of time to spend. a short film, for me, leaves more to the audience, and doesn’t take so much time. And if it’s free, then you really have no excuse not to watch it and at least have an opinion@Flowmatic\\n\\nWhats your perspective on camp looking back at it now ?\\n\\n@ChildishGambino\\n\\nI love camp. it there’s little things i’d change, cause i know how music better, but yeah. i does what it’s supposed to do@FlyTendencies\\n\\nHow do you sing so beautifully?\\n\\n@ChildishGambino\\n\\nThat’s what you call it?@A1_Day\\n\\nDid My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and Yeezus’s sound play a role in Because The Internet? How big of a influence is Kanye to you?\\n\\n@ChildishGambino\\n\\nI guess it influenced me as much as it influenced all music to be better? but honestly, his whole steez isn’t for me. I can’t do that. he just inspires me to be limitless@StefanPonce\\n\\nCAN YOU BREAK DOWN THE SONG TO “BOY BAND” ?!!!???!!!!\\n\\n@ChildishGambino\\n\\n@MYH\\n\\nHow can mirrors be real if our eyes aren’t real?\\n\\n@ChildishGambino\\n\\nMirrors aren’t real@Metron\\n\\nWhat’s the biggest opportunity that you could have taken but you missed out on in your life?

One of the ladies just said something funny cause there\\'s a lot of laughter\\n\\nSitcom laughs always freaked him out. Because most of those people are dead. Those are ghost laughs. Laughs that are supposed to be gone forever linger on earth after every mid 90s joke about teenage sex or someone saying \"don\\'t go there\".

Didn\\'t realize that they were each other\\'s only family til this very moment. When you lose that, you basically lose most of your memories, at least the accuracy of your own memories\\nHe wanted to be cremated\\nThe Boy didn\\'t really know anyone in Stockholm, but he also didn\\'t want to be in his hotel room with his father for a day. Even if he was just ashes. So he decided to search through his followers for someone from Sweden\\nSome girl named \"Hello_Pity_\" Dm\\'d him back and they were supposed to meet up after all the whatever he had to do. Her profile bio said she was half french. She looked pretty in her avi: an inverted Hello Kitty. But that really doesn\\'t mean anything at all, especially since her instagram was blocked, which is something he\\'s learned not to trust at all\\nSo he looked through her tweets, figured out a night she went to a club, used one of his dummy profiles and pretended that they\\'d met at the club that night. She had trouble remembering because, according to her feed, she was \"fuckin turnt, [CRAZY TONGUE OUT EMOJI] lol\". She added this made up dude as a friend on Facebook. Now The Boy could see her pictures\\nThe rest of her pictures confirmed she was indeed pretty\\nThis girl loves Justin Bieber though. New Justin Bieber. The \"fuck you\" Bieber.

That lie is the best way to describe this love. That feeling of not having to say \"I\\'m scared\", because you share the exact feelings without having words over or under complicate it, that\\'s worth more than protection. It\\'s a connection.

When he pulls up, he\\'s playing \"Made in America\" by JAY Z and Kanye.

Maybe he could run out the back? Where though?\\n\\nThey\\'re at the top of a mountain. If someone heard a shot in this neighborhood, they\\'d call the police immediately. Unfortunately, there isn\\'t a police department in the Palisades. He\\'d be waiting for the Santa Monica department, which would take a minute\\n\\nThe feeling The Boy had now was shockingly similar to the feeling he got at his own parties.

Not to say The Boy didn\\'t feel like he was going to die, he was certain he was going to die today. But he didn\\'t feel like today felt like a/the last day/night. Like a Wednesday that keeps feeling like a Friday. But the more he thought about it, if the last day felt like the last day, the world would be a different place. The order we have everyday would vanish if you were guaranteed a warning. People wouldn\\'t live like they do\\n\\nThey wouldn\\'t care what you thought. It\\'d be anarchy. Or a utopia. Depending on who you ask\\n\\nDude 1 puts The Boy\\'s phone in his pocket. The Boy doesn\\'t know if that\\'s a good thing or a bad thing. Dude 1 and Dude 2 start talking. It\\'s obvious they\\'re discussing The Boy\\'s fate\\n\\nIf I was the director, the one who made this moment, the one who saw this moment millennia before, the one who coded this world and allowed this to happen, I\\'d have Thundercat\\'s \"We\\'ll Die\" playing as The Boy looks around at his once castle\\n\\n...try to do your best\\n\\nOh! It\\'s like Tony Montana. But resigned and, frankly, more realistic, cause it\\'s boring. Everybody dies. Most of them are boring\\n\\nAll the dudes walk out except Dude 2. He stays. Dude 1 still has his phone as he walks out. The Boy realizes this action is bad\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0DUDE 2: Toss me your wallet\\n\\nThis is bad. The Boy tosses the wallet.

I’ve talked about this before. Rap is done. Rap is done. I love Hip Hop. I love rap, but the thing it was supposed to do it doesn’t do anymore. Like I love it as a music. It’s the same thing as like jazz. Jazz when it was doing what it was supposed to do. And people still listen to jazz now, but it doesn’t have—It’s not doing the social work it’s supposed to do anymore. And that’s not because it’s gotten bad…It’s just a different movement. Whatever movement is happening now—Like I would like to think I’m a leader of whatever movement is happening. People call it ‘new black.’ People call it whatever, but I don’t want to name it cause it’s bs to name it. As soon as it gets named that’s when you start marketing it. And it’s like ‘Ah, this is hipster.’ Cause hipster was cool until it became hipster...And then it became monetized. Same thing with Hip Hop. So, whatever this thing is. Whatever’s happening. Like whenever Jaden Smith tells me he’s like ‘I’m real excited for whatever’s happening.’ He can feel it. I can feel it.”\\n\\nLater in the interview, the Stone Mountain, Georgia singer/rapper discussed the lack of “a sense of balance” between races and also addressed crooked cops\\n\\n“That’s the thing,” he said. “People feel like that’s an attack on something. It’s like ‘I get it. I understand. You guys are in charge. You don’t want to lose the power. I totally get it’…I’m not hating on that. I totally understand. I get it. I’m just saying there’s got to be a sense of balance. Same thing with cops. It’s like ‘I get it. You’re putting your lives in danger also. But what am I supposed to do when a cop who’s a bad person does something? Who am I supposed to tell? I would call you guys, but at the same time I know what’s gonna happen.’”\\nGambino also addressed a controversial poem he penned last month following the shooting death of 18-year-old Mike Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. In the poem, he states “I wanna be a white rapper.”\\n\\nAccording to the singer/rapper, he wrote the poem, which he says was “about freedom,” while he was “in the moment.”\\n\\n“That poem was about freedom,” Gambino said. “It really was. It was about freedom. That’s what I wrote and I—People were upset. But yeah, good. A poem should make you [upset]. Like when was the last time someone wrote a poem that made you feel bad like crazy? That was heart. That’s how I felt in the moment…I just wanted to write about—I wanted to show how freedom is something that’s so great when you feel it. Like I felt it. I feel it on stage…I don’t hardly remember when I’m on stage most of the time. Cause it’s like freedom.”\\n\\nVideo of Childish Gambino’s interview with Peter Rosenberg can be found below (via 2DopeBoyz)', 'artist': 'America'}\n",
